## Countries App

For tonight, we'd like you to combine your knowledge of express, mongo and mongoose to build an application that has full CRUD on countries.

Each country should have a/an:

- name
- flag (this should be an image URL)
- capital 
- population (this should be a number)
- cities (this should be an array)

### Getting started

1. Initialize an express application (touch app.js, npm init etc.)
2. Include the required dependencies (don't forget mongoose!)
3. Create your schema and models
4. Test your models! (Just run `node NAME_OF_FILE.js`)
5. Start working on your routes and views - **Your routes must be RESTful!**

### Bonus

- Style your application using bootstrap or custom css(if you want to do this, remember to use `express.static`)
- Research `res.send` and see what happens when you send back mongoDB data with `res.send` and think about how AJAX would work with your application!
